# ENHANCEMENT: "Query Rewriting" + "Follow-up Question Handling"
#
# WHAT THIS FILE DOES
#   Turns a follow-up question that only makes sense with conversation
#   context (e.g. "what about for my spouse?") into a standalone question
#   ("What is the coverage for a spouse under this plan?") BEFORE it's
#   embedded and used for vector search.
#
# WHY THIS IS NEEDED (a subtle but important RAG failure mode)
#   Embedding models turn text into vectors based on the text's own meaning
#   -- they don't know your chat history. If a user asks "What's my
#   deductible?" then follows up with "and for my spouse?", embedding just
#   "and for my spouse?" produces a vector with almost no useful signal for
#   similarity search (it doesn't mention "deductible" at all!), so
#   retrieval would likely return irrelevant chunks. Rewriting it into "What
#   is the deductible for a spouse under this plan?" first fixes this at
#   the source, before retrieval even runs.
#
# WHY WE USE THE LLM ITSELF FOR THIS (cheap, small call)
#   Rather than hand-written heuristics (which break constantly on natural
#   language), we make one small, fast Gemini call whose only job is
#   rewriting -- a very different task from answering the actual question,
#   so it gets its own tiny, focused prompt instead of overloading the main
#   system prompt.
#
# WHEN THIS IS SKIPPED
#   If there's no chat history yet (first question in a session), there's
#   nothing to rewrite against, so we skip the extra LLM call entirely and
#   return the question unchanged -- no wasted latency/cost on the common
#   case of a single, self-contained question.
#
# INPUT / OUTPUT
#   rewrite_query(question, chat_history, llm) -> standalone question string.
