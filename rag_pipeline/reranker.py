# ENHANCEMENT: "Reranking"
#
# WHAT THIS FILE DOES
#   Re-scores the top candidates from vector (+ optional keyword) search
#   using a small cross-encoder model, and re-sorts them by that score.
#
# WHY RERANKING HELPS (beginner-friendly explanation)
#   Vector similarity search (a "bi-encoder": query and chunk are embedded
#   SEPARATELY, then compared by distance) is fast but approximate -- it has
#   to compress each chunk into one fixed-size vector without ever looking
#   at the query. A cross-encoder instead reads the QUERY and ONE CANDIDATE
#   CHUNK together, in a single pass, and directly scores "how relevant is
#   this specific chunk to this specific question" -- much more accurate,
#   but too slow to run against every chunk in the whole index. The standard
#   pattern (used here) is: use fast vector search to narrow thousands of
#   chunks down to, say, the top 10-20 candidates, THEN run the slower,
#   more accurate cross-encoder on just those few to pick the final top_k.
#
# WHY THIS IS "BEST-EFFORT" HERE, NOT REQUIRED
#   The cross-encoder model, like the local embedding model, is downloaded
#   from the Hugging Face Hub on first use. In a network-restricted sandbox
#   where huggingface.co is blocked, that download fails. Reranking is a
#   quality enhancement, not a correctness requirement (retrieval and
#   grounding still work fine without it) -- so if the model can't be
#   loaded, we log a clear warning once and silently fall back to the
#   unreranked order, rather than crashing every single chat turn.
#
# INPUT / OUTPUT
#   rerank(question, candidates) -> candidates re-sorted by cross-encoder
#   score, each candidate dict gaining a "rerank_score" key.
