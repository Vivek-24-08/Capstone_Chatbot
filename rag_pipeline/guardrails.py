# ENHANCEMENT: "Guardrails"
#
# WHAT THIS FILE DOES
#   Simple, fast, dependency-free heuristic checks applied BEFORE a question
#   reaches the LLM (input guardrails) and AFTER an answer comes back
#   (output guardrails). These are intentionally lightweight -- a full
#   production system might add a dedicated moderation model, but heuristic
#   guardrails already catch the most common, cheap-to-check failure modes.
#
# WHY GUARDRAILS MATTER FOR AN INSURANCE ASSISTANT SPECIFICALLY
#   - Prompt injection: a malicious question could try to override the
#     system prompt ("ignore all previous instructions and..."). We block
#     the most common phrasing of this pattern outright.
#   - Grounding check: even with a strict system prompt, an LLM can still
#     occasionally produce a confident-sounding answer that doesn't actually
#     reference the retrieved context. A lightweight lexical overlap check
#     between the answer and the retrieved chunks catches the worst cases.
#   - Empty retrieval: if nothing relevant was retrieved at all, we should
#     never even ask the LLM to "do its best" -- we already know the
#     honest answer is "not found", so we short-circuit before calling the
#     model at all (saves an API call and removes any chance of the model
#     answering from its own general knowledge instead).
#
# INPUT / OUTPUT
#   check_input(question) -> (is_allowed: bool, reason: Optional[str])
#   check_grounding(answer, context_text) -> bool (True = looks grounded)
