# STEP: chooses which chat LLM answers questions -- Gemini (needs an API
# key) or a Databricks-hosted Foundation Model (fully keyless inside
# Databricks). Mirrors the exact factory pattern used in
# embeddings/embedding_service.py, for the same reason: the rest of the app
# (rag_pipeline.py, query_rewriter.py) should depend only on "a LangChain
# chat model with .invoke(messages)", never on which vendor is behind it.
#
# WHY "FULLY KEYLESS" IS A REAL, MEANINGFUL DEPLOYMENT MODE
#   Every LLM API (Gemini included) normally requires your application to
#   hold a secret credential -- something that can leak, expire, or need
#   rotating. Databricks Foundation Model APIs are different when your code
#   *runs inside the same Databricks workspace* that hosts the model serving
#   endpoint: `langchain_databricks.ChatDatabricks` authenticates via the
#   Databricks SDK's ambient credential resolution, which inside a
#   Databricks notebook, job, or App requires zero configuration -- there is
#   no API key anywhere in this app's environment, config files, or code.
#   Running this same code from outside Databricks (e.g. testing from your
#   laptop against a real workspace) still works, using DATABRICKS_HOST +
#   DATABRICKS_TOKEN as an explicit fallback credential.
#
# PACING CHAT CALLS AGAINST GEMINI'S STRICT FREE-TIER QUOTA
#   Live testing showed Gemini's free tier caps CHAT generation at just 5
#   requests/minute -- far stricter than the ~100/minute embedding quota,
#   and easy to exhaust because both the query-rewrite call
#   (query_rewriter.py) and the main answer-generation call
#   (rag_pipeline.py) draw from this SAME quota. `acquire_chat_slot()` is
#   the one place both call sites pace themselves through, sharing a single
#   rate limiter so the app sees the true combined request rate rather than
#   each call site tracking (and under-counting) its own.
#
# INPUT / OUTPUT
#   get_chat_model() -> a LangChain BaseChatModel (ChatGoogleGenerativeAI or
#   ChatDatabricks), built once per process and reused.
#   acquire_chat_slot() -> blocks (sleeping if needed) until it's safe to
#   make one more chat call without exceeding the active provider's quota.
