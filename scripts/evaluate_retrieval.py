# scripts/evaluate_retrieval.py
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHAT THIS FILE DOES
#   Evaluates the FULL, DEPLOYED retrieval pipeline (RAGPipeline: vector/
#   hybrid search + reranking + score threshold, using whatever provider and
#   settings are currently configured in .env) against the same hand-labeled
#   ground truth as scripts/evaluate_embeddings.py -- reporting metrics BOTH
#   BEFORE and AFTER reranking, so you can see reranking's actual effect
#   instead of only ever seeing the final result.
#
# WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE SCRIPT FROM evaluate_embeddings.py
#   evaluate_embeddings.py answers "which raw embedding MODEL should I pick"
#   -- it embeds the corpus and questions itself, bypassing hybrid search,
#   reranking, and the score threshold entirely. That's the right tool for
#   choosing a model, but its numbers don't reflect what a real user
#   actually gets back, because the real app applies several more steps on
#   top of raw embedding similarity. This script measures THAT -- the
#   end-to-end retrieval quality of the system as deployed right now.
#
# WHY BEFORE-VS-AFTER RERANKING, SPECIFICALLY
#   RAGPipeline.retrieve() only ever returned its FINAL, post-reranking
#   list -- there was no way to see what reranking actually changed, so you
#   could never tell whether ENABLE_RERANKING (and the reranker model it
#   loads) is pulling its weight versus just trusting that it should help.
#   RAGPipeline.retrieve_with_stages() exposes both the pre-reranking
#   candidate ranking (vector/hybrid search only) and the post-reranking
#   one; this script computes every metric for both and prints/saves them
#   side by side, plus a one-line summary of how many questions reranking
#   actually improved, left unchanged, or made worse.
#
# METRICS: Recall@K, Precision@K, NDCG@K, MRR
#   All four computed by utils/retrieval_metrics.py -- see that module for
#   the exact formulas. Every question here has exactly one known-correct
#   (file, page), so num_relevant=1 throughout.
#
# WHAT GETS SAVED, AND WHERE
#   Unlike evaluate_embeddings.py (which only ever prints an aggregate),
#   this script writes ONE JSON file per run to eval_results/, containing
#   both stages' aggregate metrics AND every individual question's
#   before/after result -- so a specific regression, or reranking actively
#   hurting a specific question, can be traced back by name.
#
# PREREQUISITE
#   The vector store must already be populated: run `python -m scripts.ingest`
#   first. This script does not build embeddings itself -- it queries
#   whatever is already indexed, exactly like a real user's question would.
#
# HOW TO RUN THIS
#   python -m scripts.evaluate_retrieval
