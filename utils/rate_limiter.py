# WHAT THIS FILE DOES
#   A sliding-window rate limiter: caps how many "units" of work (an API
#   request, an embedded text) are sent within any trailing 60-second
#   window, sleeping just long enough to stay under the cap.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS AS A SHARED UTILITY
#   Originally this lived only inside embeddings/gemini_embeddings.py to
#   pace embedding calls. Live testing then surfaced the exact same problem
#   on the CHAT side: Gemini's free tier caps chat generation at just 5
#   requests/minute -- far stricter than the ~100/minute embedding quota --
#   and a user asking two or three questions in a row could exhaust it,
#   crashing the answer with a generic "service unavailable" message even
#   though the retry logic in rag_pipeline.py had already tried a few times.
#   Extracting this class means both the embedding provider and the chat
#   model share one proven pacing strategy instead of two separate,
#   possibly-inconsistent implementations.
#
# WHY PACING INSTEAD OF JUST RETRYING
#   A retry-after-failure approach still costs the user a failed attempt
#   (or several) before it succeeds, and a short backoff often isn't long
#   enough to outlast a strict per-minute quota. Pacing checks capacity
#   *before* sending a request and waits proactively, so the caller
#   experiences "this took a bit longer" instead of "this failed."
#
# INPUT / OUTPUT
#   acquire(units) blocks (sleeping if necessary) until it is safe to send
#   `units` more requests without exceeding the configured per-minute cap,
#   then returns.
